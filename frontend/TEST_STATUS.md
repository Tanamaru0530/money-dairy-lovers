## Issues to Fix

### App.test.tsx
The App component tests are failing because they depend on complex routing and authentication state. The tests need proper mocking of:
1. Authentication context
2. React Router
3. Async auth state loading

### LoginForm.test.tsx (Skipped tests)
1. Email validation test - React Hook Form validation doesn't trigger as expected in tests
2. Loading state test - Timing issues with async state updates and button disabled state

## Recommendations
1. App tests could be simplified by testing routing logic separately from auth logic
2. Consider using MSW (Mock Service Worker) for more realistic API mocking
3. The skipped tests could be fixed with better async handling or by using React Hook Form's test utilities
